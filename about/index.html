                            <p>We value your privacy, while making as little compromise as possible to your product's performance and ease of use. We will <span class="zinc-gradient"><b>never</b></span> sell your data, nor will we collect it. You can verify this, as everything is open source.</p>
                            <p>We let you do what you want with your data. Because your data is free. Not in the sense of price, but rather in cars; you can do what you want with them, and stealing them is illegal.</p>

                            <h1>Why was <span class="zinc-gradient">ZincSoft</span> founded?</h1>
                            <p>ZincSoft was founded in 2021 by two highschool students to create powerfull, open source hardware and software to help <span class="zinc-gradient"><b>progress our world</b></span>.</p>
                            <p>We founded ZincSoft after doing school research on the internet, during which we kept getting targetted ads selling an overpriced service providing what was suppost to be free and open for all. We aim to try and fulfill that goal, and we hope to succeed. You can help us by donating or contributing.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div style="margin-bottom:25%">

                            <h1>What do <span class="zinc-gradient">we</span> do?</h1>
                            <p>We aim to develop innovative and powerfull software and applications that further the concepts of communication, encryption, and network access. We also write ssoftware to make your everyday life easier without stealing your data</p>
                            <p>This is why our website is <span class="zinc-gradient"><b>fully noscript compatable</b></span> and contains no trackers. The JavaScript we do include is small, efficient, non-obfuscated, and simply serves the purpose of making your experience more engaging. If you do not want this, you can fully view and use this website by blocking all JavaScript using technologies such as noscript. </p>

                            <h1>Our <span class="zinc-gradient">open source</span> policy.</h1>
                            <p>All software and hardware that ZincSoft produces if free and open source, <span class="zinc-gradient"><b>and will be forever</b></span>. This is a major goal, but one that we can acheive.</p>
                            <p>We could go on for pages about why Open Source Software is so great, but here is the brief version: with free and open source software, you get to do whatever you want with it. Fix it, modify it, remove parts, add parts, make it your own, share your version with your friends. The possibilities are <span class="zinc-gradient"><b>limitless</b></span>! </p>
