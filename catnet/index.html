					<p>Catnet is a next generation distributed network. By design, it solves most of the issues of the internet today, as it pretains to privacy, speed, and stablility. Catnet combines Onion routing (think TOR) with routing, encryption, concurrency, and speed.</p>
					<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
					<p>Currently, we are developing CPv0. This is mainly a proof of concept specification, that can be expanded in CPv1 into something more useful.</p>

								<td>CPv0 only contains a Telnet-like protocl and ATP/EDP (like TCP/UDP).</td>
								<td>CPv1 will contain OMTP (HTTP), DSS (SSH), and much more.</td>

					<p>Catnet is not like other decentralized networks. It does not create an entirely new, uncompatable internet, over bluetooth (this seems to be the most common idea. Too bad itâ€™s very slow). Instead, it builds opon existing concepts while still replacing a decent chunk of the IP protocol suite.</p>
					<h2 id="digital-life-and-real-life-are-not-intertwined">Digital life and real life are not intertwined</h2>
					<p>Catnet uses realatively simple technology to create one way, annonomous datastreams. This allows Catnet to figure out information about the network without propagation, without allowing users to be tracked.</p>
					<h2 id="decentralization">Decentralization</h2>
					<p>Because Catnet is a network that might be used in critical applications, it absolutly cannot go down by external attack. This is why Catnet is distributed. Instead of having massive heirachies, anyone can create a head node that has the exact same permissions as every other head. This means even if you bring one down, the network will still keep going.</p>
