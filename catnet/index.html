					<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
					<p>Catnet is a next generation distributed network. By design, it solves most of the issues of the internet today, as it pretains to privacy, speed, and stablility. Catnet combines alias routing (think fast TOR) with routing, encryption, concurrency, and speed.</p>
					<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
                    <p>Currently, we are developing CPv0. While basic, CPv0 has all the components for basic datagram transmission. Because CPv0 replaces the network layer (with layers above technically being compatable but not optimised for CPv0), it bypasses the IP protocol. This is fine for small scale stuff, but when you get to larger archetectures, involing ISPs and managed routers, you need IP.</p>
                    <p>The solution is to implement CP over IP (a transmission mechanism much like 6to4). This will be developed after the completion and testing of CPv0.</p>

					<h1 id="core-ideas">Core Ideas</h1>
					<h2 id="head-nodes-and-partipant-nodes">Head nodes and partipant nodes</h2>
					<p>Catnet is not like other decentralized networks. It does not create an entirely new, uncompatable internet, over bluetooth (this seems to be the most common idea. Too bad itâ€™s very slow). Instead, it builds opon existing concepts while still replacing a decent chunk of the IP protocol suite.</p>
					<h2 id="digital-life-and-real-life-are-not-intertwined">Digital life and real life are not intertwined</h2>
					<p>Catnet uses realatively simple technology to create one way, annonomous datastreams. This allows Catnet to figure out information about the network without propagation, and without allowing users to be tracked.</p>
					<h2 id="decentralization">Decentralization</h2>
					<p>Because Catnet is a network that might be used in critical applications, it absolutly cannot go down by external attack. This is why Catnet is distributed. Instead of having massive heirachies, anyone can create a head node that has the exact same permissions as every other head. This means even if you bring one down, the network will still keep going. The internet is much like this, except for heirachies are much more pronounced (think DNS).</p>

                    <h1>CPv0 (in development)</h1>
                    <h2>CP (Catnet Protocol)</h2>
                    <p>The catnet protocol itself.</p>

                    <h2>PDP (Participant Discovery Protocol)</h2>
                    <p>Existing on the link layer, the PDP is one of the only protocols that exists below the network layer. Because routers and switches don't need understand ARP (IPv4 PDP) packets, they don't care. Thus, PDP being on the link layer is not a problem.</p>

                    <h2>WUPS (Weird Underlying-transmission Peril System)</h2>
                    <p>The WUPS protocol is used for announcing errors and successes relating to a Local Area Network (LAN). It is used by multiple other protols for the purpose of sending information that is relavent to the network itself, but not the end user.</p>

                    <h2>ATP (Advanced Transmission Protocol)</h2>
                    <p>A connection oriented protocol that uses UTP under the hood. It improves opon IP's TCP while providing security and performance boosts.</p>

                    <h2>UTP (Uncontrolled user-datagram Transmission Protocol)</h2>
                    <p>A protocol to send datagrams, improving opon convensional UDP while still remaining stateless.</p>

                    <h2>APRR (Advanced transmission protocol Packet Resend Request)</h2>
                    <p>In case of a packet that does not match its checksum (in ATP), this protocol can request that packet to be send again.</p>

                    <h2>LMK (Let Me Know)</h2>
                    <p>The LMK protocol sets up an alias. See alias routing.</p>

                    <h2>Saynet (No acronym here, sorry)</h2>
                    <p>An application layer protocol operating over ATP to provide textual bidirectional communication.</p>
