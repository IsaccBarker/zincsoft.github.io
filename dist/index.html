        The internet is a series of tubes, nothing more (Ted Stevens). This is obviously false, and has,
        ironically, become an internet meme. However, it does hold some truth. The goal of the internet is to transport information to point A to
        point B. After that, it builds onto it with higher level protocols, and makes it way up through the chain; transport, session, presentation,
        application (OSI). Web3 is suppose to be a replacement for what we have currently, Web2. It is not a series of tubes. Instead, it's a
        delicate, gold plated series of pipes and valves going every which way, powered by enslaved chipmunks. It's not the future, it's a nightmare.
        <i>Especially for those poor chipmunks.</i></p>

        To deliver a letter, you don't need to own it, nor do you need to record it on a public ledger. You can determine if it's authentic with cryptography.
        If someone wants to know if the letter was delivered, they ask, and you tell them. You don't need to bother with a ledger. As you've most likely guessed,
        the ledger in this analogy is the blockchain, and it's not needed. All the infrastructure required to support it doesn't need to exist. Instead of all
        that, Zinc takes the approach of party cryptography (that is cryptography that is negotiated between parties directly, instead of using a blockchain as
        a middleman). It's faster, better for the environment, isn't taxing on computers, is easier to adopt, and much more. It's simple.</br></br>Psst! These

        <h2 class="font-display font-bold text-4xl md:text-6xl">Web3 is intrinsically centralized;</h2>
        <h3 class="font-display text-3xl md:text-5xl pt-2">at least when you try to fix it.</h3>
        <p class="font-display text-xl pt-4 max-w-lg text-justify sm:text-right items-right tracking-wider">
        If only tkaing into account Web3's environmental problem, trying to fix it makes the system more centralized. One way that the Web3 (+ Ethereum) community has
        tried to solve this problem is with Proof of Stake. In Proof of Stake, if an entity collected enough Ether, they have a larger impact over the blockchain than
        people with less. Even though the EU's push to ban Proof of Work in favour of Proof of Stake was stopped, something like this could succeed in the future. Web3
        becomes more like Web2, only with people's money on the line.</p>
