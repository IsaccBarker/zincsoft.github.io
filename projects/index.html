					<p>Because ZincSoft has so few people, we cannot work concurrently on lots of projects at once. However, the software we do work on we hold to the highest standards.</p>
					<h1 id="catnet-huge-effort-in-progress"><a href="/catnet/">Catnet</a> (huge effort in progress!)</h1>
					<p>CATnet is a more desentralized web for a more modern age. It acts like <i>TOR</i> in that it distributes your network packets, but instead of with trusted servers, it distributes your traffic through machines locally connected to the network in an ecrypted fashion. Because CATnet distributes network traffic, it has the side effect of speeding up the interest. CATnets architechure allows the owner of a catnet server to block certain users and websites, without violating their identity. For this reason, we plan to deploy to our school once development has reached <strong>v1.0.0</strong></p>
					<h1 id="mathkit-development-halted"><a href="https://github.com/ZincSoft/MathKit">MathKit</a> (development halted)</h1>
					<p>A set of programs that quickly automate and calculate several long math processes such as Linear Regression, Quadratics, and much more.</p>
					<p>Development has been halted due to us focusing all our efforts on Catnet.</p>
					<h1 id="hydrogen-dead-use-meson"><a href="https://github.com/ZincSoft/Hydrogen">Hydrogen</a> (dead, use meson)</h1>
					<p>Hydrogen was a build system written in Rust. It aimed to be modular, and very simple, while being fast. This would make it easy to implement. However, when the developer (Milo Banks) learned of Meson, they quit development because we donâ€™t need another build system when the perfect one already exists.</p>
