					<p>Because ZincSoft has so few people, we cannot work concurrently on lots of projects at once. However, the software we do work on we hold to the highest standards.</p>

                    <h1 id="catnet-huge-effort-in-progress"><a href="/catnet/">CatNet</a> (huge effort in progress!)</h1>
					<p>CATnet is a more desentralized web for a more modern age. It acts like <i>TOR</i> in that it distributes your network packets, but instead of with trusted servers, it distributes your traffic through machines locally connected to the network in an ecrypted fashion. Because CATnet distributes network traffic, it has the side effect of speeding up the interest. CATnet's architechure allows the owner of a catnet server to block certain users and websites, without violating their identity. For this reason, we plan to deploy to our school once development has reached <strong>v1.0.0</strong></p>

					<h1 id="ZincPass"><a href="https://github.com/ZincSoft/ZincPass">ZincPass</a></h1>
					<p>A powerful and portable password manager that keeps your passwords and other info safe with 4096-bit encryption. ZincPass has all the features of many other password managers, such as autofill, while being 100% free. No catches.</p>
					<p>The main developer of this project (Eli Hatton) has slowed down work on ZincPass in favor of CatNet, but some progress is still being made.</p>

					<h1 id="DevStart"><a herf="https://github.com/ZincSoft/DevStart">DevStart</a></h1>
					<p>A tool for developers to automatically set up projects and prepare them for a productive workflow with a single command. With DevStart, you simply write a config file, and it will create a project for you, complete with file structures, GitHub repositories, build systems, and anything else you want (you can even add custom tasks)! DevStart allows for the use of multiple config files, for different languages or project types. <strong>Development starting soon!</strong></p>

					<h1 id="mathkit-development-halted"><a href="https://github.com/ZincSoft/MathKit">MathKit</a> (development halted)</h1>
					<p>A set of programs that quickly automate and calculate several long math processes such as Linear Regression, Quadratics, and much more.</p>
					<p>Development has been halted due to us focusing most our effort on Catnet.</p>

                    <hr style="margin-bottom:150px;margin-top:150px">

					<h1 id="hydrogen-dead-use-meson"><a href="https://github.com/ZincSoft/Hydrogen">Hydrogen</a> (dead, use meson)</h1>
					<p>Hydrogen was a build system written in Rust. It aimed to be modular, and very simple, while being fast. This would make it easy to implement. However, when the developer (Milo Banks) learned of Meson, they quit development because we donâ€™t need another build system when the perfect one already exists.</p>
