            The internet is a series of tubes, nothing more (Ted Stevens). This is obviously false, and has,
            ironically, become an internet meme. However, it does hold some truth. The goal of the internet is to transport information to point A to
            point B. After that, it builds onto it with higher level protocols, and makes it way up through the chain; transport, session, presentation,
            application (OSI). Current Web3 is suppose to be a replacement for what we have currently, Web2. It is not a series of tubes. Instead, it's a
            delicate, gold plated series of pipes and valves going every which way, powered by enslaved chipmunks. It's not the future, it's a nightmare.
            <i>Especially for those poor chipmunks.</i></p>

            To deliver a letter, you don't need to own it, nor do you need to record it on a public ledger. You can determine if it's authentic with cryptography.
            If someone wants to know if the letter was delivered, they ask, and you tell them. You don't need to bother with a ledger. As you've most likely guessed,
            the ledger in this analogy is the blockchain, and it's not needed. All the infrastructure required to support it doesn't need to exist. Instead of all
            that, Zinc takes the approach of party cryptography (that is cryptography that is negotiated between parties directly, instead of using a blockchain as
            a middleman). It's faster, better for the environment, isn't taxing on computers, is easier to adopt, and much more. It's simple.</br></br>Psst! These

            If only tkaing into account current Web3's environmental problem, trying to fix it makes the system more centralized. One way that the current Web3 (+ Ethereum) community has
            tried to solve this problem is with Proof of Stake. In Proof of Stake, if an entity collected enough Ether, they have a larger impact over the blockchain than
            people with less. Even though the EU's push to ban Proof of Work in favour of Proof of Stake was stopped, something like this could succeed in the future. Web3
            becomes more like Web2, only with people's money on the line.</p>

                    Currently, most Web3 proposals have privacy take a back seat to scalability, but at what point
                    are we trading our fundamental rights for an unfeasible future? Zinc does not prioritize one over
                    the other. We believe that both privacy and scalability are essential for a successful Web3
                    future. Zinc protocol provides a way for entities to communicate privately, without sacrificing
                    scalability. Our solution is the catnet, which allows for privacy-preserving computations while
                    maintaining the security and integrity of the network.</p>

                    The web should be simple, open, and fair. The web should be open for everyone to participate in
                    and the benefits of the web should be distributed fairly. We are working to create a web where
                    information is transportable, allowing anyone to participate in building a better future. This
                    cannot be achieved using a complex architecture of token ownership, financial ledgers, and

                    The truth matters. Truth applies to both management and information. Zinc will always be
                    truthful and open about our governance and operations, no matter how uncomfortable the truth
                    may be, or how much it may upset some people. The information and how we transport it is the
                    same. Zinc builds protocols that transport information, no matter its content. Zinc is a
                    protocol that enables trust and communication between entities, that's all.</p>

                    Zinc exists solely for the purpose of providing direction to our open source projects. Its legal
                    members are not dictators, but rather coordinators who help to ensure that the projects maintain a
                    consistent quality and direction. The coordinators are unpaid, and the project is maintained on a volunteer basis.
                    Zinc is an open source project, and our governance is based on the principle of open source governance.
                    This means that our coordinators are elected by the community, and that our decisions are made through a
                    consensus-based decision-making process.</p>
